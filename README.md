Hello, this project consists of a Customer Lifetime Value analysis using the Retail_II dataset imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci
.
The project fits a BG/BNB model to predict the number of transactions and the probability of churn per customer, and a Gamma-Gamma model to predict the average spending per transaction per customer.
